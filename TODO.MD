# TODO

More stuff I want to do with this project:

- [ ] Have an endpoint to show indexing progress, show it in the UI
- [ ] Fetch sources.txt file automatically
- [ ] Build in Azure Pipelines using S2I (Docker), and push to GitHub package registry
- [ ] Productionize my deployment (DNS, SSL, Docker-Compose)
